# Device Test Naming

## Rules
- Keep generated test filenames short and easy to scan on-device.
- If proposing multiple tests, requested execution order must match alphabetical order.
- Use sortable prefixes so device listing order aligns with test order.

## Recommended Prefixes
- `a_`, `b_`, `c_`
- `01_`, `02_`, `03_`
